🧩 How It Works

A user creates or joins a room using a unique room ID.

The app uses Socket.IO for signaling between peers.

Once signaling is complete, WebRTC establishes a direct peer-to-peer connection.

Users can now share video, audio, and optionally text messages in real-time.

🧠 Future Enhancements

✅ Screen sharing

✅ Recording functionality
